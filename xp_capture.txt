ollama
idhub
stood up rest api for idhub
idhub docs
bystro
deployed and maintained bystro, an ultra fast, web-hosted wes/wgs sequencing annotation tool
osf
transitioned all project archival publicaiton and data distribution hosting to the Open Science Framework (OSF) as a low cost, open source, FAIR-compliant alternative. this specifically served notable unmet user needs around accessbility and management
dataverse
cellxgene
stood up local multi-user instances of CellxGene to host high-resource processed single cell objects for faster iteration and exploration of internal use and ease of access for the scientific community
digital slide archive
stood up Digital Slide Archive instance for easier web-based interal management of vast whole slide pathology image sample set across all lab spatial projects
atlassian
implemented use of atlassian services confluence and jira across team and consortium and served as admin. 
jupyterlab hub server
stood up jupyterlab hub server in on-prem, managed device to make more substantial resources available to biologists that don't have access to hpc
sourcegraph
implemented early use of sourcegraph for secure team llm access
globus
implemented use of globus for simplified, free high-throughput data distribution to internal partners along with controled access in cross-institutional partnerships. 
google workspace
transitioned consortium use of google workspace for documents and communication collaboration. coordinated and administered numerous list-servs that served as central lines of communication for internal, consortium, and field-wide collaborations. served as super-admin for all google services, policy, and user-management across google workspace.
implemented webservices and sites for ibdgc and international collaborations
established low-cost, accessible, data distribution workflow for pathology core
acted as delegate manager for all group hpc resources

- people management
implemented a comprehensive goals setting system across team
led all technical personnel recruitment
hiring technical exam design and delivery
coached several interns to generate grant level results and pilot methodologies for future use
provided technical lead-level guidance and strategy direction across all projects
proposed and implemented alternate project structure and execution strategy led by data team member which unlocked previously untapped project capactiy and insights.
coordinated implemetation of topic-focused cross-institutional methods working groups
oversaw substantial reorganization and reapplication of 20 years of consortium study data across multiple eras of data collection, projects, and institutional partnerships
implementation or rigorous organization in confluence. not sure how to say this, but enforced a rigorous, clean information organization in confluence which held
established a personnel transition process for members leaving the team
instituted a per-project code repository management system for project-long organization of methods to elevate and simplify packaging of methods at the point of publication
implemented a quarterly team workload assessment process for lab-wide collection of project requirements, roadmap planning, and effort rebalancing
established process to review meeting load and prune wasted meeting time and organize meetings with purpose
established new lab meeting format, data round table, to encourage alternate perspectives on generation of analytical threads for otherwise languishing data sources
chief author of technical documentation for shared compute and software resources.
led dry lab as tech lead and people leader
led dcc data team as cheif data custodian (title?)

- best practices
training around github, data & methods standards, etc
ibdgc protocol sharing
established data life cycle policies to maximize storage utilization and reduce technical debt
